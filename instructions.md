Here's a breakdown of the tasks, designed for a professional-level completion by such an AI agent:

Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Functionality (Iterative Refinement)

Task 1: Environment and Dependency Setup (Agent Prompt)

Objective: Set up a Python environment and install necessary dependencies.

Instructions:
1. Create a new Python virtual environment (using venv or conda).
2. Install the Pillow (PIL) library for image manipulation.
3. Create the following directory structure:

chat_data_generation/
├── generate_data.py  # Main script 
├── text_generator.py # Module for text generation
├── image_manipulator.py # Module for image manipulation
├── utils.py # Utility functions
└── output/ # Directory for output images

Verify the installation by running a simple Pillow test script (provided).
Use code with caution.
Task 2: Random Text Generator (Agent Prompt)

Objective: Implement a Python module for generating random text strings.

Instructions:
1. Create the `text_generator.py` module.
2. Implement a function `generate_random_text(min_length, max_length)` that returns a random string of English words within the specified length range.
3. Use a library like `random` or `faker` to generate words.
4. Add basic controls for punctuation and sentence structure.
5. Write unit tests to validate the function's behavior.
Use code with caution.
Task 3: Chat Bubble Rendering (Agent Prompt)

Objective: Implement a Python module for rendering individual chat bubbles.

Instructions:
1. Create the `image_manipulator.py` module.
2. Implement a function `create_chat_bubble(text, color, font, size, shape, tail_direction)` that:
    - Takes the text, color (hex or RGB), font (path or system name), size (width, height), shape parameters (e.g., corner radius), and tail direction (left, right, none) as input.
    - Renders a chat bubble image using Pillow, drawing the text on a background with the specified color.
    - Implements different tail shapes based on `tail_direction`.
    - Returns the bubble image as a Pillow `Image` object.
3. Write unit tests to test different bubble styles.
Use code with caution.
Task 4: Image Composition (Agent Prompt)

Objective: Implement a function to compose the complete chat image.

Instructions:
1. In `image_manipulator.py`, implement a function `create_chat_image(bubbles, background_color, include_keyboard, include_top_bar)` that:
   - Takes a list of `(text, color, alignment)` tuples (where alignment is "left" or "right"), background color, and boolean flags for keyboard and top bar as input.
   - Creates a new Pillow `Image` with the specified background color.
   - Calls `create_chat_bubble` to render each bubble, determining its position based on alignment and adding variations in vertical spacing.
   - Optionally, adds a pre-designed keyboard and top bar image to the canvas if the respective flags are set to `True`. These images can be simple placeholders for now.
   - Returns the final composed image.
2. Implement realistic positioning logic: sender bubbles on the right, receiver on the left, with variations in consecutive messages from the same sender.
Use code with caution.
Phase 2: Variation Implementation and Dataset Generation

Task 5: Parameter Variation Logic (Agent Prompt)

Objective: Implement functions to manage and generate variations in parameters.

Instructions:
1. In `utils.py`, create:
    - `get_color_palette()`: Returns a list of hex or RGB color values representing realistic chat bubble colors (white, grey, green, blue, purple).
    - `get_font_list()`: Returns a list of paths or system names of common fonts.
    - `get_shape_variations()`: Returns a list of dictionaries, each defining parameters for a different bubble shape (e.g., corner radius, tail style).
2. In `generate_data.py`, implement a function `generate_variations(num_images)` that:
    - Loops `num_images` times.
    - For each image:
      - Randomly selects colors from `get_color_palette()`.
      - Randomly selects a font from `get_font_list()`.
      - Randomly selects shape parameters from `get_shape_variations()`.
      - Randomly determines the number of bubbles (e.g., 2-10).
      - Randomly generates text for each bubble using `generate_random_text()`.
      - Randomly assigns left/right alignment to bubbles, following a realistic conversation pattern.
      - Randomly chooses a darker background color.
      - Randomly decides whether to include the keyboard and top bar.
      - Returns a list of dictionaries, each containing the parameters for one image.
Use code with caution.
Task 6: Dataset Generation (Agent Prompt)

Objective: Generate the dataset of chat images.

Instructions:
1. In `generate_data.py`, implement a function `generate_dataset(num_images, output_dir)` that:
    - Calls `generate_variations(num_images)` to get the parameter sets for each image.
    - Loops through the parameter sets.
    - For each set:
      - Calls `create_chat_image` to generate the image.
      - Saves the image to the `output_dir` in both JPEG and PNG formats, with varied resolutions (e.g., 800x600, 1280x720, 1920x1080).
      - Uses a descriptive naming scheme (e.g., `image_001.jpg`, `image_001.png`).
Use code with caution.
Phase 3: Refinement and Advanced Features (Optional)

Task 7: LLM Text Generation Integration (Agent Prompt)

We can give this as a task if needed in the future

Important Considerations for the AI Agent:

Context Management: Each task prompt will include relevant code snippets from previous tasks (within the 4096 token limit). The agent will have access to the entire codebase created so far, and instructions will guide it on which parts to modify or extend.

Error Handling: The agent will be instructed to implement basic error handling and to report any errors or ambiguities encountered during code generation or execution.

Testing: Unit tests will be emphasized to ensure the correctness of individual components.

Iterative Refinement: We'll use an iterative approach, reviewing the agent's output after each task and providing feedback or corrections as needed. The prompts can be adjusted based on the agent's performance.

Code Style and Documentation: The agent will be instructed to follow consistent code style (e.g., PEP 8) and to add comments to explain the code.

Modularity: The modular structure will help the agent manage the complexity and focus on specific parts of the code within its context window.

Communication and Feedback:

We'll provide feedback in a structured format, pointing out specific areas for improvement or correction.

We can ask the agent to explain its reasoning or to generate alternative solutions if needed.

By breaking down the project into these smaller, well-defined tasks and providing clear instructions, we can effectively leverage the AI agent's capabilities to achieve a professional-level completion of this image dataset generation project. The agent's ability to understand and manipulate code, combined with our guidance and feedback, will enable it to produce high-quality results.
